<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 8, 2026</p>

<p>This privacy policy describes how SnoreGuard ("the App") handles your information. The App is developed by Yves Muheim ("we", "us", "our").</p>

<h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
<p>The App is designed with privacy as a core principle. All audio recording, snore detection, and analysis happens entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio recordings are stored only on your device and are never uploaded to any server.</li>
<li>Snore scores, sleep data, and factor logs remain entirely on your device.</li>
<li>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.</li>
<li>We do not collect your name, email, location, or any identifying information.</li>
<li>We do not create user accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Microphone Access</h2>
<p>The App requires microphone access to record audio during sleep. The microphone is used exclusively for snore detection and recording while a recording session is active. Audio data is processed on-device and is never transmitted externally.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data generated by the App (recordings, scores, history, settings) is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. You can delete all App data at any time by deleting the App from your device.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only external service used is Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Apple Health</h2>
<p>If you choose to enable Apple Health integration, the App may write sleep-related data to Apple Health. This data is governed by Apple's Health privacy framework and remains under your control.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share any user data with third parties, because we do not collect any user data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
